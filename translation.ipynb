Better, the company intends to offer extended support until 2027, which would allow it to go up to Android 15 even if the SoC support doesn't go that far! This would correspond to about 6 years of software support, unprecedented in the current mobile industry. These different measures aim to ensure that the Fairphone 4 can be used for several years with consistent follow-up and an eco-responsible approach through phone recycling and the use of materials from sustainable and equitable sources. Fairphone now certifies fair provenance for 14 key materials and the smartphone integrates a case made of 100% recycled polycarbonate. The manufacturer has also launched a living wage program aimed at improving working conditions in mines and factories among its partners. The smartphone has received TCO Certified validation for its sustainability efforts and scores 9.2 / 10 (6 / 128 GB version) and 9.3 / 10 (8 / 256 GB version) for the repairability index established in France, very high scores compared to the rest of the market. The FairPhone 4 will be available for pre-order from September 30 on the Fairphone website and will cost €579 for the Fairphone 4 in 6 / 128 GB, €649 for the Fairphone 4 in 8 / 256 GB. (Source: )\n",
